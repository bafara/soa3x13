1
00:00:01,071 --> 00:00:03,316
<i>Previously on Sons of Anarchy...</i>

2
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:06,487
<i>Dear Mo, I'm so lost here in Charming.</i>

3
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:09,848
<i>The Club, my family, everyone is a stranger.</i>

4
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:13,822
<i>I see my best friend and my wife
grown closer and closer.</i>

5
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:16,734
<i>I feel nothing, not even fear.</i>

6
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:19,952
- I'll hand-deliver Jimmy O'Phelan.
- What do you want?

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:23,157
My son, my mother and my club.

8
00:00:23,158 --> 00:00:25,236
And I'm supposed to just trust you, huh?

9
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:28,407
Hey, my club finds out, I'm dead.

10
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:32,965
It's Gemma's statement about what happened
with Polly and Edmond at the safe house.

11
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,586
If you want her clear of the homicide,
get her on board.

12
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:40,106
This is from Stahl, isn't it?
Do not get in bed with this bitch.

13
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:43,822
I am telling you.
This is what you need to do to protect SAMCRO.

14
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,359
Kill the deal,

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,377
or I'll turn my self in to the U.S. Attorney
and tell him my statement...

16
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,682
was a pack of lies you fed me.
I'm sure that agent...

17
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:57,683
you're hanging all the blame on,
will have no problem backing me up on that.

18
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,511
We know, that Jimmy has reached out to
the Russians in Northern California.

19
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,871
The ones we've been muling your handguns to?

20
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,269
Aye. You need to kill him.

21
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,023
Before he exiles some place
where we can't find him.

22
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:12,502
Comes with rewards.

23
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:15,525
We're willing to significantly
expand your gun business.

24
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:17,879
Former high ranking leaders of the IRA...

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,107
now make up the ruling
council of the Real IRA.

26
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:23,015
Did you have any contact
with any of these guys?

27
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,957
The Irish gave Jimmy save passage out of Belfast.

28
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:29,139
In exchange for my kid.
He's up north with the Russians.

29
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,266
- Putlova?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:34,965
I need you to tell me what's going on with Stahl.

31
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:36,714
You just gonna have to trust me.

32
00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:38,887
I can't protect you from Clay if he finds out,

33
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:41,464
and if you go to jail
with them knowing you're a rat,

34
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:43,749
you'll be dead in a day.

35
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,870
Hey.

36
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,230
Morning.

37
00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:04,948
Morning.

38
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,269
I love you.

39
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:12,421
I love you.

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,909
I love you too, son.

41
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:24,869
You don't know that.

42
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,363
I have a feeling.

43
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:35,627
What?

44
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:42,452
Whatever happens today,

45
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:46,003
I'm right here.

46
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:50,006
I know.

47
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:03,294
I got something for you.

48
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,538
It may be a wee bit small, by now.

49
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:10,893
All right.

50
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:23,837
- I'm so happy for you, man.
- Thank you.

51
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:40,946
Hey,

52
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:44,002
Lyla's got something she wants to say.

53
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,949
We're getting married.

54
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:52,040
- Yeah, brother.
- Thanks.

55
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,999
That's a party.

56
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:58,114
- The best change I can wished.
- I know.

57
00:05:59,431 --> 00:06:00,663
- Yeah.
- Hi.

58
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,394
Yeah.

59
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,999
- To Ope and Lyla.
- Sons!

60
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,425
Hooray!

61
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:00,788
Baby?

62
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:08,592
Hey.

63
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:10,159
I'm looking for you.

64
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,636
Yeah, I'm just cleaning up.

65
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,781
- Gotta go and see Otto.
- All right.

66
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:23,430
I'll call the Indians.
Wheres the pick-up?

67
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:26,147
I wouldn't go in there.

68
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:35,413
Sit for a sec.

69
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:44,251
What's going on?

70
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:51,792
Today's about to go off the rails, baby.

71
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:55,802
We got to find Jimmy before we go inside.

72
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:58,078
I know what you have to do.

73
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:00,999
This is more than retaliation.

74
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:11,575
We made a deal...

75
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:14,584
with the irish kings.

76
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:20,729
Taking out Jimmy gets us access to
a much higher level of merchandise.

77
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:25,505
- What irish kings?
- Real IRA council.

78
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:30,185
Same guys got us the deal
to get Abel back from Jimmy.

79
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:34,476
Redheaded godfathers.
You do not say no to these guys.

80
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,525
Hey,

81
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:43,661
this is good for us, baby.

82
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:47,538
I don’t have that many more years
to add at that table.

83
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:51,049
This is an opportunity for us to finish big.

84
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:54,567
Set us up for the rest of our lives.

85
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:58,081
While we're sittin' in a cell.

86
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:00,090
We don't know how any of that
shit is gonna shake out.

87
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:03,081
Let's not worry about that right now.

88
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:06,129
You're right.

89
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,488
I'll worry about it tomorrow.

90
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:12,433
When they carted us both of to jail.

91
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:20,136
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:32,347
I love you.

98
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,999
- This is excellent work.
- Yes, I know.

99
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:39,335
I'm finishing out here arrangements
in Santa Caterina.

100
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:42,377
- Funds should transfer this afternoon.
- Good.

101
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:44,373
Donny's closing things up around here.

102
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:47,026
He'll be back in a couple of hours.

103
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:49,744
Maybe we should try and
get a flight down tonight, yeah?

104
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:51,955
- I'll set it up.
- Grand.

105
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:05,307
Tig, can I show you something?

106
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:09,598
- It could be really important for you guys.
- Later.

107
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:12,592
Hey.

108
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:15,305
- Mine and my pop's.
- Okay. KG-9's.

109
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:18,366
We've got to call in to Lin for the other one.

110
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,645
- I'm at the station when you need me.
- Oh, you're the best,

111
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,446
Chemo-Sabi.

112
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:27,291
- That ain't funny.
- Yes, it is.

113
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:49,544
What are you doing?

114
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:51,458
I'm gonna turn my self in.

115
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:53,284
- What are you talking about?
- Drive.

116
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:55,480
- Gemma, I...
- Drive!

117
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:04,684
Yeah, Lenny is really tagged
with the gulag crew in here.

118
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:07,467
It's, uh... Putlova's muscle.

119
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:10,852
We need a location today.

120
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:15,529
I might be able to get a few minutes
with him at the fence, but...

121
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,284
it ain't gonna be easy.

122
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:21,253
We're trying to arrange whatever
we can on our end.

123
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:23,999
Yeah. Okay.

124
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,593
You're doing okay, bro?

125
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,383
Yeah.

126
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,505
Where is the case at?

127
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:37,654
I'm not really sure, my...

128
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,277
my P.D. don't speak real good english.

129
00:12:45,272 --> 00:12:47,072
P.D.? Wh...

130
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:50,901
What are you doing with a public defender?
We've put Rosen and Lowen on it.

131
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,874
They had cameras in the reading room.

132
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,882
They got me offen the peckerwood on tape.

133
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:58,353
There's not much of a defense.

134
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,830
Are you gonna plea that down?

135
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,755
I got no brace in here, brother.

136
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:05,390
Apparently, I...

137
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:09,487
continued to exhibited pattern
of aggressive behavior.

138
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:17,393
I'll be...

139
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:23,513
I'll be on the road by the time
you guys are arraigned.

140
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:30,401
I'll...

141
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:34,609
I'll do what I can to get to Lenny, all right?

142
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:38,471
- Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

143
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:59,875
Do I need to post a chaperon,

144
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:03,860
or can you ladies
chat with some civility?

145
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,430
We'll be fine.

146
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,075
Good luck.

147
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,288
What's this?

148
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:25,240
It's my statement exonerating you from the
murder of Edmond Hayes.

149
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:28,492
And Polly's death has been
ruled self-defense, so...

150
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,028
you're cleared of the homicides.

151
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:32,597
Of course there is still the...

152
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:34,986
fleeing custody charge, but with your...

153
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:39,576
recent medical flare-up,
I got it decremented to house arrest.

154
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:42,038
You'll wear an ankle bracelet
for six months, and...

155
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,559
if you behave, you'll have it off in three.

156
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:48,956
I'll deny all of it.

157
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,970
So you would sacrifice your life in prison
just to undermine my case.

158
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:59,315
I found your folder.

159
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,733
I saw what Jax is giving you.

160
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,660
You are gonna get him killed.

161
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:06,829
If not by his own club,
then by the IRA.

162
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,239
You kill the deal,

163
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,966
or I'll tell the U.S. Attorney
it's all bullshit.

164
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:14,798
Well, unfortunately,

165
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,052
my testimony is already been documented.

166
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:21,289
So even if you wanted to take the fall,

167
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,090
it's to late.

168
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,119
Looks like you'll have to trust me.

169
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,620
You actually think that's possible, don't you?

170
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:37,167
You are a naive bitch.

171
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:40,348
These deals,

172
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:42,354
these relationships,

173
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:45,455
can never work.

174
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,270
And why is that?

175
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,947
Because they're based on lies.

176
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:56,332
You're lying to your bosses,

177
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,999
Jax is lying to his club,

178
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,439
you're both lying to each other.

179
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,892
There's no trust.

180
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,492
And something will go wrong.

181
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:10,842
Somebody will get hurt.

182
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:17,629
I promise you...

183
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:21,222
it'll end badly.

184
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,880
You're late.

185
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:48,732
Just came from your mother.

186
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:51,853
She's in the cage of Charming P.D.

187
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:54,324
She tried to turn herself in...

188
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:56,380
and shit on our deal.

189
00:16:57,252 --> 00:16:59,052
Goddammed.

190
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:01,736
Doesn't matter.

191
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:05,312
She's been cleared of all the murder charges.

192
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:08,011
How?

193
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:10,801
Well,

194
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:13,534
Tyler confessed before she died.

195
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:19,188
Told me, everything that Gemma said
in her statement was true.

196
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,702
Jesus Christ.

197
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,685
It's one thing you bosses don't
know about our little deal,

198
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:34,686
but I got to think killing one of your own
might be a bad career move.

199
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:37,992
I didn't kill her.

200
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,999
Mexican bikers did.

201
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:44,370
Your mother seems to...

202
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:47,975
believe that you and I shouldn't...

203
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:49,776
trust each other.

204
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:53,267
She knows something I don't?

205
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:58,661
She thinks you're gonna get me killed.

206
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:02,362
Are you?

207
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:08,554
You boys are running out of time.

208
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:12,338
Bail hearing is set for tomorrow morning.

209
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:15,665
Clay is sitting down with Otto right now.

210
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:19,235
Hook him up with Lenny the pimp...

211
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:21,244
and we'll get some info.

212
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,585
The meeting has been arranged.

213
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,270
Good.

214
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,105
You owe me something now, don't you?

215
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,092
I remember Dooley, Brogan and Morph.

216
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:52,563
I never saw any of the others.

217
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:54,848
Put in the document along
with my statement...

218
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:58,684
about Jimmy and I'll sign off on the hole file.

219
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,815
Okay. Good.

220
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,803
Keep me on point to Jimmy.

221
00:19:05,804 --> 00:19:07,604
Absolutely.

222
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:31,747
You're waiting for a tip, shithead?

223
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:38,348
How you're doing, Lenny?

224
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:40,204
- Better than you.
- Yeah.

225
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:43,390
It's a pretty solid majority these days.

226
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:45,503
No shit.

227
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:48,791
Listen, the...

228
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:51,998
club needs a big favor.

229
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:56,435
Need you to reach out to
your eastern bloc friends.

230
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:59,665
They're protecting an Ex-IRA.
Jimmy O'Phelan.

231
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,851
Either in northern Cali or up in Oregon.

232
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:05,347
Why do you want Jimmy?

233
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:08,915
Killed five members in Northern Ireland.

234
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,716
We...

235
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:13,747
We need the location on the safehouse.

236
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:16,484
Putlova has got no love for the irish.

237
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:19,735
I'm sure he'll be open to better offer.

238
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,450
Buy him out?

239
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:26,213
That's the only we to get Jimmy.

240
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:30,103
All right. Once you...

241
00:20:30,581 --> 00:20:33,785
Once you find out what that would look like,

242
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:35,617
we got to know fast, though.

243
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:39,045
I'll pass on what I know through the attorneys.

244
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:42,244
Okay, that'll work.
I'll let Clay know.

245
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:45,365
- You take care, Lenny.
- Okay, brother.

246
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:56,626
What a crap of shit.

247
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:58,427
Hey.

248
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:01,222
Where is she?

249
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:04,282
What were we just talking about?

250
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:06,083
I'm sorry, baby.

251
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:08,817
Nothing impulsive, right?

252
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:18,720
These are reckless times, Clay.

253
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:22,743
We are all doing impulsive things,
things that we would never do otherwise.

254
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:25,863
- I know.
- I don't think you do.

255
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,844
Losing Abel,

256
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:29,645
all the deaths...

257
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,166
Every decision you make...

258
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:36,775
has to be made in the light
of these extreme circumstances.

259
00:21:37,273 --> 00:21:39,073
What are you saying?

260
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,841
It's a different time.

261
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:47,036
We can't look at Jax
in the same light as John.

262
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,878
Yeah. Okay.

263
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:59,004
Okay.

264
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:12,659
These equations were forwarded to me
by Lenny Janowitz's lawyer.

265
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,424
Don't know what it means.
Don't really want to.

266
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:17,844
20 equals zero. True.

267
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:21,425
38,358888...

268
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,135
minus 122,288818...

269
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:26,936
equals two million.

270
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:28,743
True or false?

271
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:33,093
Nice.

272
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:35,658
Give us a minute, will you?
We got to do the math.

273
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:38,219
Take a few, they're big numbers.

274
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:41,389
20 equals zero.

275
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,443
Lenny couldn't get a location.

276
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:46,026
The others are longitude and latitude.

277
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:48,405
Two million means we can buy Jimmy.

278
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:49,838
Two million, shit!

279
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,691
Why don't we just show up and take Jimmy?
We got enough hardware.

280
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:56,753
It's not gonna be the safehouse.
It's gonna be a place for the exchange.

281
00:23:56,754 --> 00:23:59,447
Trust me, Putlova is bringing an army.

282
00:23:59,448 --> 00:24:02,817
Yeah, looks like an access road
outside of Rio Vista.

283
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,618
40 minutes.

284
00:24:05,941 --> 00:24:07,741
Ope.

285
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:11,056
Tell Lowen the equation is true.

286
00:24:11,057 --> 00:24:16,057
Where the hell are we gonna get two million?
What, are we robbing banks now?

287
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:27,727
Tell Lenny's lawyer it's true.
Need a time.

288
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:32,594
You do know I charge hourly, right?

289
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,472
Just send it.

290
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:39,393
Jax, can I show you something?

291
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,390
Really important.
You really gonna want to know about it.

292
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:43,191
Not now, bro.

293
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,829
- You hear from Lenny?
- Yeah.

294
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,424
Putlova wants two million for Jimmy.

295
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,081
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey.

296
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:53,882
I need a minute.

297
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:57,781
- Where is Abel?
- Lyla and Neeta are with him at home.

298
00:24:57,782 --> 00:24:59,808
Your mom is in jail.

299
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:02,262
I know. I heard.

300
00:25:02,493 --> 00:25:05,053
The homicide charges were dropped.

301
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:07,166
She doesn't want Clay to know. She's...

302
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,028
terrified.

303
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:11,931
What's going on, Jax?

304
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:14,999
Please, you can tell me.

305
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,139
Jax!

306
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:20,045
Look!

307
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:30,471
- What's this?
- Go on.

308
00:25:30,472 --> 00:25:34,016
After Tara got kidnapped,
I tried to tell you guys about this.

309
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:36,899
When I was on the counterfeit operation for Lin,

310
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,829
I was supposed to throw away all
the misprints and dirty runs.

311
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,630
I didn't.

312
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:45,351
This are three boxes full.

313
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:47,593
Twentys, fifties, hundreds.

314
00:25:47,594 --> 00:25:50,429
Over five mil of fake currency.

315
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,417
Holy shit.

316
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:57,098
- Don't bend 'em.
- Come here, sit down.

317
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:59,529
I will lend you my hand
so that you can jerk yourself off.

318
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,410
- Come on. Take it.
- I accept that.

319
00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:05,476
Don't you point that finger at me.

320
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:07,175
Put that away.

321
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:08,914
We got Eddy to loan us his print-cutter.

322
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:11,062
It's gonna take a couple of hours.

323
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:14,490
- All right.
- Everyone of these bills is irregular.

324
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:18,138
Any screw on them,
the Russians are gonna know.

325
00:26:19,564 --> 00:26:21,940
Maybe we need to create
some sort of distraction.

326
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:23,542
Putlova is too smart.

327
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:26,607
I don't see how this is going down
without it turning bloody.

328
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:28,597
Well, than we better bring everybody.

329
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:30,398
Just in case it does.

330
00:26:32,273 --> 00:26:35,571
If we can front-load the stacks with real cash,

331
00:26:35,572 --> 00:26:38,700
could buy us enough time to
get Jimmy out of there.

332
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:41,389
Hey, I got 40 bucks in my wallet.

333
00:26:43,513 --> 00:26:45,313
I got an idea.

334
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:49,524
Putlova wants two million for Jimmy.

335
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,869
Jesus Christ.

336
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,607
We got our hands on some counterfeit cash,

337
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,837
but I got to pet it out with real bills.

338
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:57,702
Buy us some time to get Jimmy out of there.

339
00:26:57,703 --> 00:27:00,214
Where did you get the counterfeit cash?

340
00:27:00,215 --> 00:27:02,015
Not your worry.

341
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,510
I need money.

342
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,369
I still have access to the 250k...

343
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,186
that we've used for Tara's ransome.

344
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:13,128
That should do it.

345
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:18,890
What happens when the club
asks you where you got it?

346
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:20,758
I'll tell 'em I was in evidence here.

347
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,319
That I got Unser to sign it on.

348
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:27,765
We're gonna be there.

349
00:27:27,973 --> 00:27:29,893
- At the exchange.
- No.

350
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:35,214
If the Russians see you,
they will kill Jimmy.

351
00:27:36,403 --> 00:27:38,540
If my club sees you,
they'll know someone ratted.

352
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:40,525
We can't take that risk.

353
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:44,432
It's the only way you get the cash.

354
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,191
I'll give you the location.

355
00:27:54,192 --> 00:27:57,373
But you gotta hang back a few miles at least.

356
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:59,174
All right.

357
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:04,565
We'll put Jimmy in the van,

358
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,461
you send in your team,
pretend you're after the Russians.

359
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:10,529
Let us go, grab Jimmy.

360
00:28:14,574 --> 00:28:16,374
Fair enough.

361
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,399
I'll set it up.

362
00:28:35,252 --> 00:28:39,267
We've confirmed the charter flight
this afternoon from San Jose.

363
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:41,764
That's great.
That's wonderful.

364
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:44,391
Is Donny back yet?

365
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:48,103
No, I don't think so.

366
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:31,467
You're ready?

367
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:33,887
- Yeah.
- Two mil. More or less.

368
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:35,936
KG-9's, shotguns, mac-10.

369
00:29:41,592 --> 00:29:45,432
Flag 'em up to you lads,
you're gonna need them.

370
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:49,012
You sure we can't spare one off the prospects?

371
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:51,689
We don't know what Putlova is gonna show up with.

372
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,422
We need bodies.

373
00:29:53,423 --> 00:29:56,175
At least till we make the exchange.

374
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,710
Yeah, okay.

375
00:29:58,742 --> 00:30:00,937
- Tara's here.
- Right on.

376
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:03,865
We keep you safe.

377
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:08,503
Yeah. Come on.

378
00:30:17,595 --> 00:30:20,469
Okay.
I got it.

379
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:22,988
She's all set.

380
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:29,351
You sure about this?

381
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:31,683
I know that we can do it.

382
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:35,536
Admit it, you need me.

383
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:39,491
Yes, I do.

384
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:43,999
Need you to wear this.

385
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,315
Fancy.

386
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:01,851
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

387
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:03,652
To us.

388
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:06,751
Yeah.

389
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,140
Promise you'd tell me everything?

390
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:15,185
You'll know everything soon enough, babe.

391
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,219
Okay.

392
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:37,284
You guys headed out?

393
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:39,926
What gave it away?

394
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:46,308
Lowen is down at the station.
Finishing up Gemma's release.

395
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:48,229
She should be home soon.

396
00:31:48,516 --> 00:31:50,316
Okay. Thanks.

397
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:54,742
- And I'm all set.
- Good.

398
00:31:55,073 --> 00:31:56,873
You...

399
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:00,254
You stay hole.

400
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:02,655
Will do.

401
00:32:08,457 --> 00:32:10,471
What you do for us?

402
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:16,253
It won't be forgotten.

403
00:32:28,868 --> 00:32:31,334
- We're all set?
- Yeah, it's under it depth.

404
00:32:31,335 --> 00:32:33,177
We make no mistakes.

405
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,717
Jackie boy.

406
00:32:42,057 --> 00:32:43,857
You make it quick.

407
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,067
- You're good, old man.
- Take care of yourself, bro.

408
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:52,194
Yeah.

409
00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:54,361
All right, bro. All right.

410
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:55,699
- Good luck, man.
- Yeah.

411
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,500
Let's go, boys.

412
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,688
Come on, let's move it.

413
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,852
When you got the text,
you'll let us know.

414
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:05,006
Then deliver these two letters.

415
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:06,991
I know. We'll handle it.

416
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,823
I love you, son.

417
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:20,273
I love you, too.

418
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:34,368
You're all right?

419
00:33:34,865 --> 00:33:36,367
Yeah.

420
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:38,224
Let's just finish this.

421
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:10,269
No Donny?

422
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,070
Don't make sense.

423
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,477
Maybe he changed his mind.

424
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,843
Didn't Luke just up and leave you, too.

425
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:20,724
Luke didn't leave.
He got taken out.

426
00:34:28,374 --> 00:34:30,174
Where we going?

427
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:32,821
We need to pick something up.

428
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,350
What the hell is this?

429
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:52,107
Sorry, Jimmy.

430
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:53,798
Jesus, Victor.

431
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:55,922
After all I've done for you?

432
00:34:55,923 --> 00:34:58,283
The money, the guns?!

433
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:01,326
Don't do this.

434
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,123
Million per bag.

435
00:35:32,124 --> 00:35:35,973
- 50 stacks, 20k in each.
- Thank you.

436
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:42,183
Moment.

437
00:36:09,757 --> 00:36:12,445
Five more minutes and we're moving.

438
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:29,426
- We're good.
- Excellent.

439
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,430
Clay. Jackson.
Lovely to see you.

440
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:48,454
- Pleasure doing business with you.
- Yes.

441
00:36:48,577 --> 00:36:50,343
Take care, gentlemen.

442
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:52,144
Viktor.

443
00:38:06,356 --> 00:38:08,156
Tara, come here.

444
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,400
Almost done, Jimmy.

445
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:24,746
- Strict to the garage, okay?
- Absolutely.

446
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:27,626
- You're good?
- Go. Come on.

447
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,346
Where to?

448
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:10,783
It's fake.

449
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:12,584
Go! Get them!

450
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:23,439
Seems like Viktor has been
doing a little counting.

451
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,444
Here they come.

452
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,442
Close it up.

453
00:40:07,443 --> 00:40:09,823
Yes, ma'am.
Let's go. Move.

454
00:40:28,658 --> 00:40:30,458
Go, go, go!

455
00:40:52,393 --> 00:40:54,589
Put out an APB on the Russians.
I want my money back.

456
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,390
I'm on it.

457
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:02,455
He's not here.

458
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:07,973
Shit!

459
00:41:33,887 --> 00:41:36,927
- Where is he?
- Warm and cozy.

460
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,431
What the hell are you pulling, huh?

461
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:40,250
Just keeping us both honest.

462
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:45,251
You get Jimmy and my statement
when my club gets free of hard time.

463
00:41:48,844 --> 00:41:50,429
My recommendation...

464
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,930
that the federal automatic weapons
charges will be reduced from...

465
00:41:52,931 --> 00:41:54,774
15 to three years.

466
00:41:54,897 --> 00:41:56,822
Parole in 14 months.

467
00:41:56,823 --> 00:41:59,255
All that needs is my signature.

468
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:05,469
- Based on me turning over Luke?
- It's a sound record, yeah.

469
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,623
And for that...

470
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:10,496
you give me this.

471
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,180
Your statement of cooperation.

472
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:17,269
You'll show your full knowledge
of the gun running operation...

473
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,308
and any illegal activities perpetrated
by the irish council and Jimmy O'Phelan.

474
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:23,869
All that needs is your signature.

475
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:27,861
I sign this,

476
00:42:28,351 --> 00:42:30,827
what's to stop you getting the IRA?

477
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:33,880
Let us rot in prison for 15 years?

478
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:38,118
What's to stop you...

479
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,279
from delivering this to your lawyer
and killing Jimmy?

480
00:42:42,504 --> 00:42:43,894
Now, you...

481
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,695
just lied to me.

482
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:49,816
So it's your turn for
a show of good faith.

483
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:12,783
I'm officially a rat.

484
00:43:14,188 --> 00:43:15,988
Your turn.

485
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:26,452
Where is Jimmy?

486
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:30,181
- Don't do this.
- Nothing changes.

487
00:43:30,182 --> 00:43:34,150
I just need to see him alive
and then I sign it.

488
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:36,753
There is no play here.

489
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,633
Follow me.

490
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:09,420
- We're okay?
- I don't know.

491
00:44:09,972 --> 00:44:11,772
Okay.

492
00:44:13,972 --> 00:44:16,906
- Shit!
- Good afternoon.

493
00:44:18,938 --> 00:44:20,738
Where's Jimmy O?

494
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:24,398
Okay, look, I can have a designation
here in 20 minutes...

495
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:27,791
and they'll shred this white trash shithole.

496
00:44:34,415 --> 00:44:36,215
Get him.

497
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:57,519
Let's go.

498
00:44:59,535 --> 00:45:01,360
My goddess for the american justice system.

499
00:45:01,361 --> 00:45:03,297
Jimmy O'Phelan, you're being
taken into custody...

500
00:45:03,298 --> 00:45:07,189
on suspicion of conspiracy,
committed terrorism and criminal acts.

501
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:12,190
Sorry things didn't work out he way
you planned, boys. Look at the irish though, yeah?

502
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:19,198
How'd you know he was here?

503
00:45:27,346 --> 00:45:29,858
Guess your VP made a deal.

504
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,546
- Son of a bitch!
- Wait.

505
00:45:33,547 --> 00:45:36,270
- What is she talking about?
- You made a deal for Jimmy?

506
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:37,525
What?

507
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,568
- I did it for the club.
- You rat!

508
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:41,354
- You're ratting!
- I got no choice!

509
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:44,454
- Look at the due that we're facing!
- All this time we've been tracking Jimmy,

510
00:45:44,455 --> 00:45:46,045
you knew you gotta turn
him over to this bitch?

511
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:48,252
- He blew up five of our men!
- He was Chib's nephew.

512
00:45:48,253 --> 00:45:49,697
I know! Sorry!

513
00:45:49,698 --> 00:45:52,250
She made him do it. He really had no choice, Clay.

514
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:54,363
You hear me? You are dead!

515
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:56,810
Dead!

516
00:45:56,811 --> 00:45:58,289
Go on.

517
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:00,850
You just signed my death warrant.

518
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:03,739
I'm sorry, but you know what?
Your mother was right.

519
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,785
This could have never worked.
There's just no trusts.

520
00:46:06,786 --> 00:46:10,626
I had to make sure that the prince had turn rat.

521
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:16,534
Let's go.

522
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:20,045
Come on, people.

523
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:22,998
Jax, come here.

524
00:46:27,044 --> 00:46:28,844
Arrest them.

525
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:33,834
Let's go.

526
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:50,543
The club will be out in three years,
if they don't kill anyone,

527
00:46:50,544 --> 00:46:52,709
parole in 14 months.

528
00:47:24,605 --> 00:47:27,767
- Make sure they're separate.
- All right.

529
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:37,034
Come on, sit down.

530
00:47:37,035 --> 00:47:38,835
Down.

531
00:49:31,046 --> 00:49:32,966
What's this idiot doing?

532
00:49:36,229 --> 00:49:38,029
It's Unser.

533
00:49:40,034 --> 00:49:43,382
Should I pull over?
He might know something.

534
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,351
Jesus Christ. Yeah, pull over.

535
00:50:05,689 --> 00:50:07,250
What the hell is this, Wayne?

536
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:09,381
Sorry, I didn't have you cell number...

537
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,410
and I didn't wanna put this out
over the radio.

538
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:13,701
What?

539
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:15,858
I got an anonymous tip.

540
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,383
Propably bullshit.

541
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:20,447
But they said, that four or
five of Jimmys guys are...

542
00:50:20,448 --> 00:50:23,878
gonna be waiting for you by the Newton turnout.

543
00:50:23,879 --> 00:50:26,311
That's only a few miles south.

544
00:50:26,497 --> 00:50:30,059
I can call the Sanwa Sheriffs
and have them check it out.

545
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,824
- No, I...
- Sheriffs are idiots. You guys check it out.

546
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:34,820
Wait. I don't wanna leave you alone.

547
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:37,509
I'll stay.
I'll call for backup.

548
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,541
- She'll be safe.
- Good.

549
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:42,342
It's okay. Go.

550
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,940
Really?

551
00:51:16,854 --> 00:51:19,414
I got stage-3 cancer, sweetheart.

552
00:51:19,772 --> 00:51:21,756
I ain't got that in my purse left.

553
00:51:27,748 --> 00:51:29,548
No, thanks.

554
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,565
You should really have some.

555
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:45,901
You got to be shitting me.

556
00:51:47,787 --> 00:51:50,283
What the hell is going on here?

557
00:52:28,906 --> 00:52:31,722
Take care of our girls, Filip, yeah?

558
00:52:38,831 --> 00:52:40,631
Oh, yeah.

559
00:53:19,467 --> 00:53:21,663
This is insanity, Opie.

560
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:26,664
You have any idea what kind of
heat is this gonna bring to the club?

561
00:53:27,263 --> 00:53:29,433
Put your hands on the wheel.

562
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:33,379
Please.

563
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,516
- Put your hands on the wheel.
- Please.

564
00:53:40,627 --> 00:53:42,537
Please, don't do this.

565
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:44,895
Wait.

566
00:53:44,896 --> 00:53:46,545
Please, Opie.

567
00:53:46,546 --> 00:53:49,556
Please, you had mercy before.
I'm begging you.

568
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:51,357
Don't do this.

569
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:55,123
And now I don't.

570
00:54:03,821 --> 00:54:05,770
This is what she felt.

571
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:29,328
Hey, let's go!

572
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:39,467
- Is that the deal?
- Yeah.

573
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:43,837
The left side.

574
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:46,334
I had rage work done on the right.

575
00:54:48,364 --> 00:54:51,335
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

576
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:53,675
Let's go, kids.

577
00:56:55,874 --> 00:57:00,485
"Dear Jackson, the truth about
your fahter is in these letters."

578
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:04,942
"You should know John like I did.
Maureen."

579
00:58:06,387 --> 00:58:08,567
We need to see you.

580
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:18,497
Jax wanted you to read this.

581
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:20,542
Then burn it.

582
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:24,969
- What is it?
- I don't know.

583
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:29,406
Is Tara here?

584
00:58:30,718 --> 00:58:32,518
No.

585
00:58:33,888 --> 00:58:36,704
- She's at Jax's.
- Okay

586
00:58:36,705 --> 00:58:38,505
Have a good night.

587
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:08,266
<i>Hey, mom.</i>

588
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:12,306
<i>If you're reading this, that means
Stahl and Jimmy are dead.</i>

589
00:59:12,307 --> 00:59:15,315
<i>And the club will be doing short time.</i>

590
00:59:16,448 --> 00:59:19,083
<i>I'm sory it had to be this way, mom.</i>

591
00:59:19,084 --> 00:59:21,677
<i>I know, how painful it's been for you, but...</i>

592
00:59:21,678 --> 00:59:23,478
<i>I couldn't tell you.</i>

593
00:59:24,214 --> 00:59:26,198
<i>We made you an accessory.</i>

594
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:28,189
<i>It was a club vote.</i>

595
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,610
<i>I'd never turn on my club or my family.</i>

596
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:37,623
<i>I'm not my father.</i>

597
00:59:39,478 --> 00:59:42,683
<i>- I love you more than you could ever know.
- I love you more than you could ever know.</i>

598
00:59:42,684 --> 00:59:46,624
<i>- I'd do anything to be with you.
- I'd do anything to be with you.</i>

599
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,148
<i>Every day...</i>

600
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:51,412
<i>it becomes more clear that I don't belong here.</i>

601
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:54,752
<i>I'm certain now that Clay and Gemma
are together.</i>

602
00:59:54,753 --> 00:59:57,569
<i>They barely try to hide it from me.</i>

603
00:59:58,668 --> 01:00:00,999
<i>Gemma hates my empathy.</i>

604
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,960
<i>She hates all of me.</i>

605
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:05,601
<i>Her show is terrifying.</i>

606
01:00:06,849 --> 01:00:09,409
<i>I know my days are numbered, Mo.</i>

607
01:00:09,796 --> 01:00:11,721
<i>And when these letters stop...</i>

608
01:00:11,722 --> 01:00:15,669
<i>you can be certain that my death
will come at the hands of my wife...</i>

609
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,470
<i>and best friend.</i>

610
01:00:19,175 --> 01:00:23,113
<i>At least my sweet Thomas
will never suffer my life.</i>

611
01:00:23,114 --> 01:00:24,914
<i>I miss him so much.</i>

612
01:00:26,264 --> 01:00:29,856
<i>I only pray that Jackson
finds a different path.</i>

613
01:00:29,857 --> 01:00:32,993
<i>He already reminds me so much of myself.</i>

614
